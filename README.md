# Partially Monotone Layer

Partially monotome layer (`pmlayer`) is a library for neural network models.
It provides several neural network layers to add monotonicity constraints on neural network models.
Current implementation is available only for PyTorch.

Read the [documentation](https://ibm.github.io/pmlayer/) to get started, and feel free to contact us for any inquiry.

# Installation

You can install `pmlayer` by using the `pip` command:

```pip install pmlayer```
